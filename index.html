         <h2>My Biography</h2>
         <br>
         <h4>My life before joining AltSchoolAfrica</h4>
         <p>My journey before joining altshoolafrica was just a little different from what altshoolafrica stands for. Even though my first degree has no relationship with tech unless there is anything called Sociology of Tech lol. After graduatting and completed my NYSC i joined an Integration systems Companywhere we deply and integrate systems like; Intruder Detection systems, Access Control systems, License Plate Recognition and Fire Alarm systems excited
         <p>After working there for four years, i Proceeeded to join another tech company where i was managinng their ecommerce website. At that time they were using shopofy, so i was working at the backend uploading and updating there products and handling orders</p>
         <p>After working there for 2 years, i felt a need for a change and i left to pursue my Forex Tading career. All the while i was working in those different companies, i was tradig by the side. It was just time to focus fully on what i love to do. It was while trading forex that i realized my true love for Tech... I did a lot of research regardinng where i would enrole for my desired course which is Cloud Engineering. After an exhaustive research i found AltSchoolAfrica, thereafter i read reviews about them and it was 99% positive. So i needed not to look elsewhere, and thats why i hit them up and subscribed... Here we are today, stil grinding</p>

         <h3>My Goals at School of Engineering</h3>
         <p>My primary goal at the School of Engineering is to gain a deep understanding of cloud technologies and become proficient in deploying and managing cloud infrastructure. I aim to acquire hands-on experience with various cloud platforms and tools, and to develop the skills necessary to design, implement, and maintain scalable and secure cloud solutions. Additionally, I hope to collaborate with peers and industry professionals to enhance my knowledge and stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the field.</p>
